# Cyber Discovery App

Source code for the cyber discovery app.  You should be able to build it from source on Android, and we have a prebuilt [apk or ipa](https://github.com/CyberDiscovery/Cyber-Discovery-App/releases/tag/0.3) for android and iOS respectively.

## Features

* The app has countdowns to all forthcoming events in the Cyber Discovery calendar.
* The app has a schedule for certain activities during events showing when they start, finish and how much of the activity has happened. 
* The app has a soundboard with some of our favorite clips from VC and Agent J.
* The app has the latest articles from the [Cyber Discovery Medium](https://medium.com/cyber-discovery) embedded for easy access.

## Compilation Instructions

### Android
* Ensure that flutter is installed and that running `flutter doctor` produces no errors.
* Download the source from the releases page. 
* Navigate to the root of the downloaded folder.
* Run `flutter build apk`.
* If you navigate to the build directory then app then apk then release you should find your apk file if everything went to plan. 
### iOS
* Buliding iOS from source isn't possible due to a signing limitation by Apple. Please use the compiled [ipa](https://github.com/CyberDiscovery/Cyber-Discovery-App/releases/tag/0.3) and sideload it using Cydia Impactor.
